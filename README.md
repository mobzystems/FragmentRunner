# FragmentRunner
## Installation

Too simple: download MOBZystems.FragmentRunner.exe and start it.

## Use

* Choose the tab with the language of your choice (C#, VB.NET or JScript)
* Modify the source code presented to your liking, but keep the declaration of the main() method intact
* Press F5 or clik the Run button to run the code
* Modify the arguments passed to main() if you want. Separate arguments with a pipe symbol

FragmentRunner does not attempt to save your code. Copy the source code and paste it somewhere else if you're happy with the results.

To try out different fragments at once by selecting the language in the top toolbar and pressing "New Fragment"
